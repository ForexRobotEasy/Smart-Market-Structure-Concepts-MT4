# Smart Market Structure Concepts MT4

This is a code for an expert advisor in MetaTrader 4, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The purpose of this expert advisor is to analyze the market structure and open and close positions based on certain criteria.

## How it works

1. The code includes necessary libraries for trading and charting functionalities.

2. Global variables are defined to set parameters for the expert advisor. These variables include:
   - `trade`: An object of the `CTrade` class for trading operations.
   - `enableAlerts`: A boolean flag to enable or disable alerts.
   - `alertLevel`: An integer value representing the alert level.
   - `takeProfit`: A double value representing the take profit value.
   - `stopLoss`: A double value representing the stop loss value.

3. The expert advisor is initialized in the `OnInit` function. The expert advisor parameters are set using the `trade` object.

4. The expert advisor starts running in the `OnTick` function, which is called on every tick of the market.

5. The current market information, such as bid and ask prices, is retrieved using the `SymbolInfoDouble` function.

6. The market structure is calculated using the `CalculateLiquidity`, `CalculateEntryPoint`, and `CalculateExitPoint` functions.

7. If the entry point is valid (determined by the `IsValidPoint` function), a buy position is opened at the entry point using the `PositionOpen` method of the `trade` object.

8. If the exit point is valid, the buy position is closed at the exit point using the `PositionClose` method of the `trade` object.

9. If alerts are enabled, alerts are shown based on the liquidity and price characteristics.

10. The `CalculateLiquidity` function calculates liquidity based on the difference between bid and ask prices.

11. The `CalculateEntryPoint` function calculates the entry point as halfway between the bid and ask prices, based on the liquidity.

12. The `CalculateExitPoint` function calculates the exit point as halfway between the ask and bid prices, based on the liquidity.

13. The `IsValidPoint` function checks if a point is valid by comparing it to zero.

14. The expert advisor is stopped in the `OnDeinit` function. All open positions are closed using the `PositionCloseAll` method of the `trade` object, and all chart objects are removed using the `ObjectsDeleteAll` function.
